This is a guide for setting up a private LoRaWAN network using The Things Network Stack for LoRaWAN V3 on a server.
If you already have some knowledge about how the stack works and if you are comfortable with a command line, this is the perfect place to start.

In this guide we will get everything up and running on a server using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/). So you can easily reproduce the same steps on any system nad deployment.

**Note:**
For now, the web interface Console is not available; in this tutorial, we will use the command-line interface (CLI) to manage the network.
